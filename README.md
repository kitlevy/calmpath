# CalmPath

**Find your CalmPath** - Free, accessible mental health tools for when you need a moment to calm down.

## What is CalmPath?

CalmPath is a web application designed to provide immediate, in-the-moment support for people experiencing panic attacks, anxiety, or overwhelming stress. Unlike long-term treatment options, CalmPath offers simple, evidence-based exercises that anyone can use anytime, anywhere–no sign-up required.

## Our Mission

CalmPath was created to fill a crucial gap in mental health support: providing accessible, in-the-moment tools for people actively experiencing a panic attack. While long-term treatments like therapy, medication, and stress management are essential, few resources exist to help someone cope as a panic attack is happening. CalmPath offers simple, evidence-based exercises that anyone can use anytime–at school, at work, or anywhere–to regain a sense of calm and control when it's needed most.
