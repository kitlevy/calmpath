            <p>
                CalmPath was created to fill a crucial gap in mental health support: providing accessible, in-the-moment tools for people actively experiencing a panic attack. While long-term treatments like therapy, medication, and stress management are essential, few resources exist to help someone cope as a panic attack is happening. CalmPath offers simple, evidence-based exercises that anyone can use anytime – at school, at work, or anywhere – to regain a sense of calm and control when it’s needed most.
